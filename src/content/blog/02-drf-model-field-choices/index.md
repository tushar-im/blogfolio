In many Django Rest Framework (DRF) projects, you may have models with fields that use `ChoiceField` to restrict the values that can be stored in the database. For example, a `status` field might have choices like `["Draft", "Published", "Archived"]`. When building a frontend application, itâ€™s often necessary to retrieve the available choices for these fields to render dropdowns, radio buttons, or other UI elements.

In this post, Iâ€™ll show you how to create a reusable **`GetFieldChoicesMixin`** that can be added to any `ModelViewSet` to provide the available choices for `ChoiceField` fields in your models.

## Why Provide Field Choices?

Providing field choices in your API has several benefits:
- **Frontend Flexibility**: The frontend can dynamically render UI elements (e.g., dropdowns) based on the available choices.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the frontend and backend are always in sync regarding the allowed values for a field.
- **Reduced Hardcoding**: Avoids hardcoding choices in the frontend, making your application more maintainable.

---

## Implementation

The `GetFieldChoicesMixin` is a custom mixin that adds a `field_choices` action to your `ModelViewSet`. This action returns the available choices for all `ChoiceField` fields in the model.

### Step 1: Create the Mixin

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the `GetFieldChoicesMixin`:

```python
# core/api/mixins.py
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.decorators import action


class GetFieldChoicesMixin:
    """
    Adds a GET action : `field_choices`
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Returns choices for BaseModel fields with attribute `choices`.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    """

    def get_choices(self, choices_tuple):
        keys = ["name", "value"]
        choices = [
            {key: value for key, value in zip(keys, choice_tuple)}
            for choice_tuple in choices_tuple
        ]

        return choices

    def get_choice_fields_data(self, choice_fields):
        choice_fields_data: list = []

        for choice_field in choice_fields:
            field_data: dict = {}
            field_data["name"] = choice_field.name
            field_data["choices"] = self.get_choices(choice_field.choices)
            choice_fields_data.append(field_data)

        return choice_fields_data

    def get_choice_fields(self, model_fields):
        choice_fields: list = []

        for field in model_fields:
            if field.choices is not None:
                choice_fields.append(field)

        return choice_fields

    @action(detail=False, methods=["get"])
    def field_choices(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        queryset = self.get_queryset()
        model = queryset.model
        choice_fields = self.get_choice_fields(model._meta.fields)

        response_data: dict = {}
        response_data["model"] = model.__name__
        response_data["fields"] = self.get_choice_fields_data(choice_fields)

        return Response(response_data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

### Step 2: Add the Mixin to Your ViewSets

You can now add the `GetFieldChoicesMixin` to your `ModelViewSet` or `ReadOnlyModelViewSet` classes. Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this:

```python
# core/api/viewsets.py
from rest_framework import mixins, viewsets
from core.api.mixins import GetFieldChoicesMixin


class BaseModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet, GetFieldChoicesMixin):
    pass


class BaseReadOnlyModelViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet, GetFieldChoicesMixin):
    pass
```

With this setup, any `ModelViewSet` that inherits from `BaseModelViewSet` or `BaseReadOnlyModelViewSet` will automatically have the `field_choices` action available.

---

## Example Usage

Letâ€™s say you have a `Post` model with a `status` field that has the following choices:

```python
# models.py
class Post(models.Model):
    DRAFT = "Draft"
    PUBLISHED = "Published"
    ARCHIVED = "Archived"

    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        (DRAFT, "Draft"),
        (PUBLISHED, "Published"),
        (ARCHIVED, "Archived"),
    ]

    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default=DRAFT)
```

When you make a `GET` request to the `field_choices` action, youâ€™ll get a response like this:

```json
{
  "model": "Post",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "status",
      "choices": [
        {"name": "Draft", "value": "Draft"},
        {"name": "Published", "value": "Published"},
        {"name": "Archived", "value": "Archived"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This response can be used by the frontend to dynamically render a dropdown for the `status` field.

---

## How It Works

1. **`get_choices`**: Converts a tuple of choices (e.g., `[("Draft", "Draft"), ("Published", "Published")]`) into a list of dictionaries with `name` and `value` keys.
2. **`get_choice_fields_data`**: Iterates over the fields with choices and prepares the data for the response.
3. **`get_choice_fields`**: Filters the model fields to find those with `choices` defined.
4. **`field_choices`**: The DRF action that handles the `GET` request and returns the choices for all `ChoiceField` fields in the model.

---

## Conclusion

The `GetFieldChoicesMixin` is a powerful and reusable way to provide field choices in your Django Rest Framework API. By adding this mixin to your `ModelViewSet`, you can ensure that your frontend always has access to the latest choices for `ChoiceField` fields, making your application more dynamic and maintainable.
